# Network Analysis - Web Shell

## Scenario

The SOC received an alert in their SIEM for ‘Local to Local Port Scanning’ where an internal private IP began scanning another internal system. Can you investigate and determine if this activity is malicious or not? You have been provided a PCAP, investigate using any tools you wish.

## Objective

Analyze the provided PCAP file to investigate the 'Local to Local Port Scanning' alert, determine if the activity is malicious or legitimate, and provide evidence-based conclusions using appropriate tools.

### Skills Learned

- **Packet Capture Analysis:** Learn how to capture and examine network traffic to identify unusual patterns like port scanning.
- **Protocol Dissection:** Gain experience in dissecting various network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) to analyze specific packet details.
- **Traffic Filtering:** Practice filtering specific IP addresses, ports, and protocols to focus on the relevant traffic for analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Learn how to spot anomalies in traffic patterns, such as unusual frequency or volume of requests.
- **Flow Analysis:** Study communication flows between internal systems to detect unauthorized or suspicious interactions.
- **Evidence Collection:** Collect and interpret network data to support incident investigation and reporting.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic to investigate the 'Local to Local Port Scanning' alert.
- Packet Capture File (PCAP) provided for detailed analysis of network communication between internal systems.
- VirtualBox used as the virtual machine platform to simulate the environment for traffic analysis, ensuring a controlled and isolated space for investigation.
